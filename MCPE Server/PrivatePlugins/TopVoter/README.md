This plugin is is a release on [Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/) what is does is shows you the Top (set number) of Voters in a Floating Text.

You can click [here](https://github.com/jaylac2000/ScepterNetwork/tree/master/MCPE%20Server/PrivatePlugins/ScepterVoting) to go to my modified version

I use this version of the plugin in non-production servers such as the Hub Server where voting does not need to take place.

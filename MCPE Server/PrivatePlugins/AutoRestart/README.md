# AutoRestart

This plugin Auto Restarts the server at the given time, also auto reconnects you to the hub (lobby).

It adds the public command /timer (/t) so you can see how long until the server restarts

It also adds the command /restart (/r) which you can use from in-game to restart the server.

^ no-one has access to that command

# ApolloSpawners

I no longer use this plugin on my servers because it was causing huge amounts of lag

--------------------------------

Spawners Plugin

CURRENT FEATURES:

commands:
- /spawnershop (/sshop)
- /spawner

features:

- Adds spawners
- Adds spawner shop

--------------------------------

Even tho, my server changed from Apollo to Scepter, I just left this plugin as "ApolloSpawners" since this plugin is no longer in use anymore anyways

The plugin I use for spawners now is [BurgerSpawners](https://github.com/Heisenburger69/BurgerSpawners)

# AutoRestart

THIS WAS REDONE INTO EACH SERVERS CORE

This plugin Auto Restarts the server at the given time, also auto reconnects you to the hub (lobby).

It adds the public command /timer (/tmr) so you can see how long until the server restarts

It also adds the command /restart (/rst) which you can use from in-game to restart the server.
